## Yes A Rat
Yes A Rat is an alternative version of Not A Rat.

What does it do? Exactly the same! Except we don't try to avoid any *potential* flag

In the Releases, Yes A Rat is also given.

So if you want to test it in a rat detector, it'll be detected, even tho it is the same as Not A Rat (except for the anti-flags missing)
