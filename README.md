# Not A Rat
Not a Rat is a Forge mod, which logs your token while being undetected by [isthisarat](https://isthisarat.com/).

This mod wasn't made to be used as a Rat but just an example of how dumb these websites are, and how dumb most Rats are (if we ignore obfuscated ones that obviously are detected).

Rat makers just think people won't put them into a website ([even tho there are still people putting Skytils](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/942860271825875025/1213171828093100142/image.png?ex=65f4814f&is=65e20c4f&hm=d5a685536d7a5ab19b565cab2577c73c519d43bb6b3abd202505d1f488ba532e&)) but there's more and more people that do it, so I give them a free solution :)

No jokes, if som1 smart enough see this, just report it to the website admins, or just use my code to do whatever you want. Also if you find a website/just anything that detects it as a Rat, PLEASE make an issue or contact me on my discord @ghosty920, I'll love the move!

If you have free time, just test it by yourself, and, maybe, over time it'll start to become detected, right?

If you want to improve the code, I'll add a small list of things to do but I'll see to do them later anyway. Or just improve the code, idk…
- Send it to a webhook (even if you don't make it "hidden" to the detector, idc as long as it's small and not using a full (by full I mean with also the Footer and Author things, like what for?? just delete it no??) useless class like everyone)
- Pizza Client Anti Stealer bypass, I didn't cover it in this code but it might be still useful to do it just for showcase

## Yes A Rat
In the Releases, I also put a YesARat file. This file is exactly the same code as NotARat but without using Reflection.

So if you want to test it in a rat detector, it'll be detected, even tho it's exactly the same thing. GG [isthisarat](https://isthisarat.com/) ig…
