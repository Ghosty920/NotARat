# Not A Rat
[Click here to go to the download page to test it by yourself.](https://github.com/Ghosty920/NotARat/releases/latest)

**This project is for educational purposes only.**

Not A Rat is a Forge mod, which logs your token while being undetected by [isthisarat](https://isthisarat.com/), [ratterscanner](https://ratterscanner.com/) (they are the most popular by far, but not a single detector can find Not A Rat).

This mod wasn't made to be used as a Rat but just an example of how dumb these websites can be, and how dumb most Rats are.

Rat makers just think people won't put them into a website ([even tho there are still people putting Skytils](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/942860271825875025/1213171828093100142/image.png?ex=65f4814f&is=65e20c4f&hm=d5a685536d7a5ab19b565cab2577c73c519d43bb6b3abd202505d1f488ba532e&)) but there's more and more people that do it, and some are smart enough to try going through scanner flags.

This mod is a showcase of what we can easily do without obfuscation to prevent a mod from being detected as a Rat. 

Also if you find a website/just anything that detects it as a Rat, PLEASE [open an issue](https://github.com/Ghosty920/NotARat/issues/new) or contact me on my discord @ghosty920, I'll love the move! (btw if it doesn't work on RatterScanner I'll know it)

PS: It isn't tested on Pizza Client but may works. It shouldn't work with mods like NoSession. Also I do not plan on adding a password stealer or anything related to stealing important private data, that was never my plan.

## All Websites this was tested on

If you see that a detector is missing, even if it doesn't bypass, please tell me.
